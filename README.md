# meet_in_the_middle

This program will prompt the user to provide a filename. Then it will read in a comma delimited list of integers
from the csv indicated by the user. It will then output the median of that list. You are welcome to use the files Data.csv and Data2.csv that I have included in this repo to test the program.

Requirements:
In order to run the program, you will need to be able to compile and run C++ programs on your machine.

To run the program:
```bash
g++ main.cpp && ./a.out
```
